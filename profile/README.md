####  Research Projects  ðŸ”­ :electron:	

About: Any one who has been part of the academic model very well knows how broken the publication model is. In the software industry hackers(makers) have 
adopted the open source and many of the alrge software companies are the biggest contributors. Similarly, OpenAI and DeepMInd have shown that it is possible to pursue moonshot idea and Research outside of academia in a sustainable manner. It is also clear from the no. of publications available on 
ArXiv that authors donâ€™t care about getting their ideas stolen. At DaVinci lab we believe Exchange of ideas always leads to a net positive and that institutional boundries are artificial. 



### Past Projects: 

At Da Vinci Labs, we study and develop intelligent systems that support models targeted at thinking, perception and action. The projects are aimed at tackling hard problems related to healthcare,climate change, eduation, food security and so on. Inspired by the Open Source Software movements and research labs like DeepMind and OpenAI, we will share our findings publicly.  


###### Healthcare 

Digitization of healthcare data along algorithmic breakthroughts in AI will have a major impact on healthcare delivery in coming years. I'm particularly interested in application of AI to assist clinicians during partient treatment in a privacy preserving way. While scientific knowledge can help guide interventions, there remains a key need to quickly cut through the space of decision policies to find effective strategies to support patients during the care process. 
 
- In  [MIMIC-RL](https://github.com/asjad99/MIMIC_RL_COACH) I investigate the problem of developing a Clinical Decision Support System for Sepsis Management using Deep Reinforcement Learning. In our implementation we try to answer the following question: Given a particular patientâ€™s characteristics and physiological information at each time step as input, can our proposed framework learn an optimal treatment policy that can prescribe the right intervention(e.g use of ventilator) to the patient each stage of the treatment process, in order to improve the final outcome(e.g patient mortality)?. see [[Blog_post](https://www.asjadk.io/decision_support/)] for more details.

- Medical Data is often geographically dispersed distribtuted and privacy concerns can prevent us from building a central data-warehouse. Using Techniques like fedderated learning and differential privacy we can extract process models from distributed healthcare process logs. We explore the multi-party compute with the the framework of federated learning. see paper for more details. [[paper](https://github.com/asjad99/Distributed-Process-Mining/blob/main/Distributed_Process_Mining.pdf)]. 

###### Process Oriented Data Science  

Take a look at the [Survey]() for a broad overview of AI's impact on supporting and improving business processes.

AI plays a key role in operational and strategic Business decision making. I have been involved in the following projects for my PhD thesis:  

 - At operational level AI can provide recommendations to support business process executions. Deep Learning Architectures LIKE LSTMs, MANNs and Transformers provides methods for modeling sequential data problems. In  [DeepProcess:](https://github.com/asjad99/DeepProcess) Project we use Memory Augmented Neural Networks  for Predictive Process Monitoring. see  [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00938.pdf)] [[Blog_post](www.asjadk.io/deepprocess/)]


###### Behaviour Modeling of Organizations 

AI is about decision-making under uncertainty. At Strategic level AI can help bussiness come up with robust plans. We explore this in the Alpha-GS project: [Alpha-GS](https://github.com/asjad99/rosetta_stone) - Decision making in adversarial settings using Game tree Search Combined With satisfiability(SAT) [[Blog Post](https://www.asjadk.io/strategic_resilience/)]
