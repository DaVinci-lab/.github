#### About

At Da Vinci Labs, we study and develop intelligent systems that support models targeted at thinking, perception and action.


#### Research Focus and themes  ðŸ”­ :electron:	

- Healthcare Applications
- Process Oriented Data Science  
- Emerging AI-enabled trends 
- Behaviour Modeling
- Sequential Decision Modeling 


#### Projects List: 

 The projects are aimed at tackling hard problems related to fundamental research and application areas like healthcare, climate change, eduation, food security and so on. Inspired by the Open Source Software movements and research labs like DeepMind and OpenAI, we will share our findings publicly.
